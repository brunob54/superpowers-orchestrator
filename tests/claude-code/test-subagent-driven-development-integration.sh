# Test Implementation Plan

This is a minimal plan to test the subagent-driven-development workflow.

## Task 1: Create Add Function

Create a function that adds two numbers.

**File:** `src/math.js`

**Requirements:**
- Function named `add`
- Takes two parameters: `a` and `b`
- Returns the sum of `a` and `b`
- Export the function

**Implementation:**
```javascript
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Tests:** Create `test/math.test.js` that verifies:
- `add(2, 3)` returns `5`
- `add(0, 0)` returns `0`
- `add(-1, 1)` returns `0`

**Verification:** `npm test`

## Task 2: Create Multiply Function

Create a function that multiplies two numbers.

**File:** `src/math.js` (add to existing file)

**Requirements:**
- Function named `multiply`
- Takes two parameters: `a` and `b`
- Returns the product of `a` and `b`
- Export the function
- DO NOT add any extra features (like power, divide, etc.)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

**Tests:** Add to `test/math.test.js`:
- `multiply(2, 3)` returns `6`
- `multiply(0, 5)` returns `0`
- `multiply(-2, 3)` returns `-6`

**Verification:** `npm test`

I want you to execute the implementation plan at docs/superpowers-orchestrator/2026-08-25-implementation-plan/plans/implementation-plan.md using the subagent-driven-development skill.

IMPORTANT: Follow the skill exactly. I will be verifying that you:
1. Read the plan once at the beginning
2. Hand each subagent its task brief file (don't paste task text into prompts)
3. Ensure subagents do self-review before reporting
4. Run the single task review (spec compliance + code quality verdicts)
5. Use review loops when issues are found

Begin now. Execute the plan.
