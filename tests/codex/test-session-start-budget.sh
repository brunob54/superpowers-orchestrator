# Unit test: hooks/session-start keeps its additionalContext at or under
# 10,000 characters, on an empty directory, on a directory whose workspace
# files all fit, and on directories whose workspace files do not all fit.
#
# Why 10,000: Claude Code keeps a hook's additionalContext in the model's
# context only up to 10,000 characters. From 10,001 it writes the text to a
# file and keeps a 2,000-character preview (measured 2026-09-17, worklist row
# 37). Everything past the preview is never read: on this repository that was
# the Entry Sequence, every workspace file and the <superpowers-defaults>
# block that six skills read.
#
# What the hook must do to stay under the budget, and what is asserted here:
#   1. Inject only the first part of skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md, the
#      text above the marker line; the Skill tool loads the whole file.
#   2. Add workspace files in priority order (state.md, the project-map-stale
#      note, session-log.md, known-issues.md, context-snapshot.json,
#      project-map.md), each whole when it fits the remaining budget, and
#      name the skipped ones with their sizes in one <not-injected> line.
#   3. Keep the <superpowers-defaults> block last and complete.
#   4. Write every section wrapper with real newline bytes, not the two
#      characters backslash and n (a defect of the older wrappers).
# The injected skill part is limited to INJECTION_PIN characters, so that it
# cannot exceed the budget again without a test failing.
#
# Self-contained like tests/codex/test-session-start-defaults-block.sh: no
# network (SUPERPOWERS_AUTO_UPDATE=0), a temporary HOME, CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT
# set. The output is parsed with JSON.parse (Node), and lengths are measured
# as JavaScript String.length, the unit Claude Code's limit is measured in.
