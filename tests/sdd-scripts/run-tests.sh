# from one plan to another. Under the new layout the plan basename carries no
# date prefix (`plans/<slug>.md` instead of `plans/<date>-<slug>.md`), so the
# archive folder is named `<slug>`. The rule is unchanged; this asserts the
# result, which the spec's testing strategy requires.
#
# Register a known outgoing plan explicitly, rather than relying on the
# state the "symlinked plan path" block above happens to leave behind: that
# block SKIPs on a filesystem without symlink support (e.g. Windows Git Bash
# without developer mode, a platform this repository claims to support),
# in which case no plan.ref exists here and the first switch below would
# report no prior workspace at all instead of an archive slug.
