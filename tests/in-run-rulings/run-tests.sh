# in-run-rulings wording test suite: static checks on the wording that the
# autonomous in-run decisions design requires in
# skills/orchestrating-development/SKILL.md, its two controller prompt
# templates, and skills/multi-code-review/SKILL.md.
# Pure bash + grep/awk; no claude invocation.
# Windows note: never reads standard input through its device path and uses
# no process substitution (neither is reliable in Git Bash on Windows).
#
# Matching rule (design R11): binding literal labels are byte pins, matched
# exactly and case-sensitively; free-text fragments are matched
# case-insensitively, because free text gets reworded by review fixes.
# Every fragment is scoped to the section it pins, so that deleting the
# rule cannot pass on a mention of the same words elsewhere in the file.

# Needle strength (F5, review round 16): a handful of named design
# properties — the answer-tag default, guard 4's `(user)` lookup and its
# escalate-when-unsure branch, the closed escalation-label set, and the
# fork independence rules — carry an explicit negative assertion that the
# INVERTED sentence does not satisfy the needle, on top of the ordinary
# positive pin, because a short bare-word needle can survive an inversion
# of the sentence it was meant to guard (a `plan governs` -> `escalated`
# inversion or similar keeps a bare `escalated` needle satisfied). Beyond
# this named set, judging whether a given needle is strong enough to catch
# every plausible inversion of its sentence is a reviewer's call, not
# something a further mechanical sweep of this file can close on its own:
# that residue is a stated limitation of this suite, not a gap left to fix
# here.

# through the same helper as the byte-exact check above, so the two can never
# disagree about the text they search. The two failure causes get distinct
# messages.
#
# `fold_range` turns every line wrap into a space, so a marker separated from
# the sentence by a wrap would read as `** In-run resumes …`. The scan
# therefore steps over any spaces before it looks for a `*` run, and tells an
# emphasis marker on the sentence from a neighbouring bold span by the run's
# OTHER side: a `*` run before the match whose own left neighbour is a space
# (or the start of the text) OPENS a span around the sentence, while one whose
# left neighbour is any other character CLOSES an earlier span — the
# paragraph's `**The cap.**` lead-in ends that way and is not emphasis on the
# sentence. The mirror rule applies after the match: a `*` run followed by a
# space (or the end of the text) closes a span around the sentence, while one
# followed by any other character opens a new span, such as a bold lead-in of
# the next sentence.
# M1: the nested-span check below (the bold_count/under_count parity test)
# used to count `**`/`__` runs over the WHOLE log-entry subsection before the
# match. That made it a proxy, not the property: any odd-parity token earlier
# in that whole subsection — an unrelated unbalanced marker anywhere above
# the cap sentence — would flip the parity and report an emphasis marker that
# is not actually there. Restrict the parity scan to the cap sentence's own

# Row 53: every read of a diff of the plan file turns off the two helper
# programs a repository can configure. A textconv filter turns a file into
# text before git compares it; an external diff driver replaces git's own
# comparison. Either one rewrites the output these steps read, and the revert
# restores text taken from that output, so a read written without the two
# options can write wrong plan text. Measured with git 2.50.1: `git diff`
# runs both kinds of helper program by default and `git show` runs a textconv
# filter by default, so the skill writes one uniform spelling on every diff
# read rather than two spellings to remember.
# Every read is found by its shape, not by a list of spellings. A first
# version counted two literal commands, and a review showed the hole: a read
# added later that names another revision, such as `git show <resume commit>
# -- <plan path>`, was invisible to it and the suite stayed green. Mutation
# testing then showed two more spellings that slipped through: a read written
# without the `--` separator, and one naming another placeholder. So the
# pattern now matches any git diff or git show that names a plan placeholder,
# whatever stands between them, bounded by the backtick that closes the
# command in the Markdown text.
# A read of the file itself, written `git show <commit>:<plan path>`, runs no
# helper program and needs no option, so those are removed by their colon.
# One accepted false failure: a future sentence that quotes a read WITHOUT the
