# analyze-compaction test suite: unit tests on tools/analyze-compaction.js,
# the script that reads one session transcript and reports what the session
# did right after each context compaction (the compaction probe of
# tests/claude-code/compaction-probe.md judges its verdict from this output).
# Pure bash + node; no claude invocation.
# Windows note: never reads standard input through its device path and uses
# no process substitution (neither is reliable in Git Bash on Windows) —
# everything goes through temp files.
#
# The fixture `fixtures/compaction.jsonl` is hand-built (19 records, indexes
# 0 to 18): a Skill call and its injection, an automatic compaction with its
# summary and re-attachments, then the reads and writes the guard asks for in
# every form the tool must recognise (a grep of the headings, a Read cut by a
# notice in the result text, a Read cut by a notice that comes as a separate
# attachment record, a sed read of a range, a ruling appended by a Bash
# heredoc, an Agent dispatch, a ruling written by Edit and one by Write), and
# finally a manual compaction with nothing after it. One requestId is written
# twice so the deduplication of API calls is exercised.
# The fixture `fixtures/edge-cases.jsonl` holds a `null` line, a blank line
# and two records without a `message` field.
