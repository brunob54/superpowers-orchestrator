# Multi-Review: Multi-Round Independent Document Review — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Status:** Draft — pending user approval

## Problem

Today the user manually opens a fresh Claude Code session to review a written
spec, merges its findings back into the document, and repeats ~3 times — then
does the same for the plan. This design automates that loop inside the plugin,
preserving the property that made the manual process valuable: each review is
independent (no authoring context, no prior findings).

## Scope

A new standalone skill `skills/multi-review/` that runs an N-round
review-and-merge loop on a document using subagents, plus small integrations
into the two existing approval gates:

- **brainstorming** — runs the loop on the spec between the spec self-review
  (checklist step 10) and the user review gate (step 11).
- **writing-plans** — runs the loop on the plan between Self-Review and
  Execution Handoff.
- **Direct invocation** — `/multi-review <doc-path> [N]` on any Markdown
  document.

## Non-Goals

- No shell-script orchestration and no separate headless `claude` sessions —
  subagent dispatch (Task tool) only.
- No per-round user approval. The single existing user gate remains the only
  approval point.
- No Codex/Cursor support. Subagent dispatch is Claude Code-only, same as
  subagent-driven-development. On platforms without the Task tool the gate
  integrations are skipped (the host skill's own self-review still runs).
- Does not replace code-review gates on implementation
  (requesting-code-review, SDD task reviews). This reviews *documents*.
- Reviewer severity calibration is guided, not guaranteed (see Limitations).

## Parameters

- **N (round cap):** if the user stated a count in conversation, use it.
  Otherwise ask once via a single question — at gate time for gate
  invocations, immediately for direct invocations (default **3**;
  **0** skips the loop entirely, logged as skipped). Valid N is an integer
  0–10 (the ceiling bounds cost); anything else → 3. If several counts were
  stated in conversation, the most recent wins.
- **Doc type:** `spec`, `plan`, or `general`. Gate invocations pass the type
  explicitly (brainstorming → `spec`, writing-plans → `plan`). For direct
  invocation the controller infers from the path — under `docs/specs/` →
  `spec`, under `docs/plans/` → `plan`, anything else → `general` — and an
  explicit user statement overrides the inference. Plans can live at
  user-preferred locations (writing-plans allows overriding its default
  path), so if a `general`-inferred document carries a `**Spec:**` header
  line, the controller warns and asks the user to confirm the type instead
  of silently reviewing a plan under `general` lenses. Determines lens
  phrasing and reviewer inputs.
- **Spec path (plan reviews only):** the writing-plans gate passes the spec
  path it already knows. On direct invocation of a plan, the controller reads
  the plan header's `**Spec:**` line (a `**Spec:** docs/specs/<file>.md` field
  that the writing-plans integration adds to the Plan Header template); if
  the line is absent — e.g. a pre-existing plan — it asks the user once. If
  the user cannot supply one, the no-locatable-spec fallback in Error
  Handling applies.
- **Reviewer model:** inherit the session model. The dispatch template states
  this explicitly so the model line is never accidentally omitted-but-meant.

## Architecture: The Loop

Controller = the main session executing the skill. All state lives in two
files: the target document and the sidecar review log.

For each round `i` in 1..N:

1. **Dispatch one reviewer subagent** (`general-purpose`, session model) using
   `reviewer-prompt.md` with the round's lens (see Lens Rotation). Inputs are
   ONLY the template placeholders:
   - target doc path
   - doc type
   - lens name + lens instructions (verbatim from the lens table)
   - for `plan` docs additionally the spec path (coverage cannot be judged
     without it)
   No free-form context may be added. The conversation, design rationale,
   prior rounds' findings, and the review log are never passed.
2. **Reviewer reviews and reports** findings in a fixed format (below).
   The reviewer has read access to the codebase for feasibility checks but is
   explicitly barred from: the Skill tool, `*-review-log.md` files, other
   documents under `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/` (except the spec when
   reviewing a plan), and the git history of the target document.
   "No material issues under this lens" is an explicitly legitimate verdict —
   the prompt states that inventing findings to fill a report is a review
   failure.
3. **Controller triages and merges:**
   - Critical and Important findings: apply the edit to the document, OR
     reject as a false positive **with a stated reason** in the log. Silent
     drops are not permitted.
   - Minor findings: apply at the controller's discretion; always logged with
     disposition.
4. **Append a round entry** to the review log (format below).
5. **Convergence check:** the loop exits early only after **two consecutive
   clean rounds** — rounds whose reviewer reported zero Critical and zero
   Important findings. Because consecutive rounds use different lenses,
   convergence always reflects at least two distinct perspectives — a single
   clean round never exits (which would leave the other lens classes
   unexamined). An `inconclusive` round (see Error Handling) breaks the
   clean streak. Severities are read from the report's **enumerated
   findings**, never the count line (the Verdict counts are informational;
   on disagreement the enumerated findings win), and never post-triage —
   controller rejections can never manufacture convergence. With N ≤ 2
   mid-loop early exit cannot fire, but the convergence *status* is still
   reported: whenever the final two rounds were clean, the gate report says
   "converged" even if that coincided with the cap; N = 1 always reports
   "cap reached."

**After the loop exits** (converged or cap reached): the controller runs a
self-review checklist on the final merged document. At gate invocations this
is the host skill's own checklist — brainstorming's Spec Self-Review or
writing-plans' Self-Review — which is already loaded in the controller's
context (the host invoked multi-review), so no cross-skill file read is
needed. Direct invocations always use the four-item list (placeholder scan,
internal consistency, ambiguity, scope) regardless of doc type — the
post-loop check is a merge-error backstop, not a substitute for the host
gate, and this avoids content-drift coupling with the sibling skills'
checklists. Then the controller reports to the user at the existing gate:
rounds run, per-round finding counts, converged vs cap reached, and the
review log path.

**Once per gate:** the loop runs at most once per approval gate. The detection
signal is the review log: if the sidecar already contains an invocation entry
for this document created at this gate, the loop is not re-run (this survives
session restarts mid-gate). If the user requests changes at the gate, only the
doc type's self-review checklist re-runs on the edited document. Another
multi-review pass happens only if the user explicitly asks for one.

## Lens Rotation

One reviewer per round, each round a different lens. For N > 4, lenses cycle
from lens 1 (the document has been revised since, so a re-pass is meaningful).

| Round | Lens | `spec` focus | `plan` focus | `general` focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Correctness & completeness | Requirement gaps, contradictions, missing error handling | Spec coverage: every spec requirement maps to a task | Factual/internal correctness, missing sections |
| 2 | Ambiguity & testability | Requirements interpretable two ways, unverifiable claims | Placeholder scan, vague steps, missing verification commands | Ambiguous statements, unverifiable claims |
| 3 | Feasibility & architecture risk | Fit against the actual codebase, hidden coupling, cross-platform concerns | Type/signature consistency across tasks, hidden inter-task dependencies | Practicality against the repo it lives in |
| 4 | Adversarial failure modes | "How does this design fail in production?" | "Where does an executing agent go wrong following this?" | "How does acting on this document go wrong?" |

## Reviewer Report Contract

The reviewer's final message is the report (no preamble, no narration):

```
### Verdict
Critical: <n> | Important: <n> | Minor: <n>
(or exactly: "No material issues under this lens.")

### Findings
#### Critical
- [C1] <doc section>: <what is wrong> | <why it matters> | <suggested fix>
#### Important
- [I1] ...
#### Minor
- [M1] ...
```

The **enumerated findings are authoritative**; the Verdict count line is
informational and the controller recomputes counts from the enumeration when
they disagree. The sentence "No material issues under this lens." is used
only when there are **zero findings of any severity**; a Minor-only round
reports counts (`Critical: 0 | Important: 0 | Minor: <n>`) with empty
Critical/Important sections.
Every finding must reference a section or line of the target document.

**Interaction with the subagent-stop guard:** the plugin's
`hooks/subagent-guard.js` scans every subagent's final message for
skill-name patterns and blocks apparent skill leakage. Reviewer reports about
documents that discuss skills — common in this repository — trip it as false
positives (observed during the design-phase dogfood run of this very spec).
The guard therefore gains a narrow exemption for multi-review reviewer
reports (recognition mechanism — agent-description prefix or fixed report
marker — decided in the plan), and its `SKILL_NAMES` roster gains
`multi-review` so the new skill stays inside the guard's coverage. Both
changes appear in Files.

Calibration (adapted from `task-reviewer-prompt.md`): **Critical** = acting on
the document as written would produce wrong or broken results for a core
scenario. **Important** = the document cannot be trusted until fixed — a
contradiction, a missed requirement, an ambiguity that changes implementation.
**Minor** = polish, style, "could be broader."

## Review Log (Audit Trail)

Sidecar file next to the target document: `<doc-basename>-review-log.md`
(e.g. `2026-07-19-multi-review-design-review-log.md`). Created when the skill
is invoked — including an N=0 skip, which gets a one-line `skipped` entry.
Round numbering continues across invocations (a user-requested re-run appends
rounds k+1... under a one-line invocation note — headers never collide). Each
invocation note records date, N, and the **invoker** (`gate: brainstorming`,
`gate: writing-plans`, or `direct`) — the invoker field is what makes the
once-per-gate detection implementable: a prior direct pass or N=0 skip is
distinguishable from a gate-initiated one. One entry appended per round:

```
## Round <i> — <lens name> — <model>
**Reviewer verdict:** <n> Critical, <n> Important, <n> Minor
**Converged:** yes/no   <!-- "yes" only on the round where the loop exits via
                             convergence (second consecutive clean round);
                             every other round is "no" -->
### Dispositions
- [C1] applied — <doc section>: <finding summary> → <change made>
- [I1] rejected: <reason> — <finding summary>
- [M2] deferred — <finding summary>
```

Rounds where the loop was skipped (N=0) or a reviewer failed twice are logged
as `skipped` / `inconclusive` entries. Reviewers are barred from reading this
file; its predictable `-review-log.md` suffix makes the prohibition
enforceable in the prompt.

## Error Handling

- **Reviewer subagent fails or returns an unusable report** (missing verdict
  block, no findings format): retry once with the identical dispatch. On
  second failure, log the round as `inconclusive` — it never counts as
  convergence — and continue to the next round.
- **Target document missing:** stop and report to the user; nothing dispatched.
- **N invalid** (not an integer 0–10, per Parameters): use default 3.
  **N = 0:** skip, log.
- **Plan review with no locatable spec:** proceed with lens phrasing that
  omits spec-coverage checks — round 1 falls back to the `general` column's
  correctness focus — and record in the log that coverage was not reviewed.

## Files

**New:**
- `skills/multi-review/SKILL.md` — controller procedure (loop, triage rules,
  convergence, log format, gate-integration notes).
- `skills/multi-review/reviewer-prompt.md` — dispatch template in the
  established `task-reviewer-prompt.md` style: `[PLACEHOLDER]` slots
  (`[DOC_PATH]`, `[DOC_TYPE]`, `[LENS_NAME]`, `[LENS_INSTRUCTIONS]`,
  `[SPEC_PATH]` for plans), Subagent Rules block, calibration section,
  fixed output format.

**Deleted:**
- `skills/brainstorming/spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md` and
  `skills/writing-plans/plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md` — orphaned
  single-shot reviewer templates from an earlier release (referenced only in
  RELEASE-NOTES.md), superseded by `reviewer-prompt.md`. Leaving them would
  create two competing document-review mechanisms.

**Modified:**
- `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` — new checklist step between 10 and 11
  ("Multi-round spec review — invoke `superpowers-optimized:multi-review` on
  the saved spec"), digraph node, exit-criteria line, and the once-per-gate
  rule at the user review gate.
- `skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md` — new step between Self-Review and
  Execution Handoff, plus the once-per-gate rule.
- `hooks/skill-rules.json` — register `multi-review` with keywords
  ("multi review", "review rounds", "independent review", "review the spec",
  "review the plan") and intent patterns
  (e.g. `review\s+(the\s+)?(spec|plan|document)\s+(again|\d+\s+times)`,
  `(run|do)\s+\d+\s+review\s+rounds?`).
- `hooks/subagent-guard.js` — add `multi-review` to the `SKILL_NAMES` roster,
  and add the narrow reviewer-report exemption described in Reviewer Report
  Contract (a longer roster otherwise widens the guard's false-positive
  surface for exactly these reports).
- Release bookkeeping per repo policy: `VERSION`,
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  (+ `plugin.universal.yaml` meta), `RELEASE-NOTES.md` entry.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** existing hook unit-test harness validates `skill-rules.json`
  structure; add pattern-match cases for the new entry if the harness
  supports per-skill routing assertions (`tests/skill-triggering/` covers
  prompt → skill routing).
- **Behavioral** (`tests/claude-code/`, slow suite): seed a temp project with
  a deliberately flawed spec (one contradiction, one ambiguity) at
  `docs/specs/<name>.md` — the path matters: doc-type inference must resolve
  it as `spec`, which is what the test exercises — and invoke
  `/multi-review <spec> 2` headlessly, assert: (a) the sidecar
  `*-review-log.md` exists with ≥1 round entry, (b) the spec file was
  modified OR every Critical/Important finding in the log carries a
  `rejected: <reason>` disposition (a clean or all-rejected round legitimately
  leaves the doc untouched), (c) the log contains a disposition line or an
  explicit no-findings verdict. Follow existing
  test-script rules: no assertions on hardcoded git history; unique session
  ids per invocation.
- **Manual gate check** after plugin reinstall: run brainstorming end-to-end
  on a toy feature and confirm the loop fires before the user review gate.

## Limitations (accepted, documented)

- **Severity calibration is imperfect.** A reviewer may under- or over-rate
  severity, causing premature convergence or (more likely, per observed
  experience) never converging. Premature exit requires two consecutive
  under-rating reviewers under different lenses; the N cap bounds the
  never-converge case; the final user gate is the backstop. Lenses not yet
  run when the loop exits are by definition unexamined — accepted, since the
  exit requires two distinct clean lenses.
- **Independence is enforced by prompt, not sandbox.** The template's
  fixed placeholders prevent context leakage by construction, and the prompt
  bars the review log and doc git history — but a reviewer with repo read
  access could in principle encounter them. Accepted as residual risk.
- **Claude Code only.** Codex/Cursor sessions skip the loop.
